# Cubecraft

A simple voxel engine I created for my CS 4300: Computer Graphics course.
It's not the prettiest code!

## Usage
1. Run a Python Simple HTTP Server:
   `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ after running the server, using Google Chrome.

## Controls
- Fly through the world using WASD, Shift (Fly Down), Space (Fly Up), and your mouse.
- Left click to place a block.
- Right click to remove a block.
